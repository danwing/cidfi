                       CID Flow Indicator (CIDFI)
                        draft-wing-cidfi-latest

Abstract

   Host to Network signaling and Network to Host signaling can improve
   the user experience to meet network's constraints and to provide
   differentiated service to individual packets.

   This document describes how clients can communicate with their nearby
   network elements so their QUIC and DTLS streams can be augmented with
   information about network conditions and packet importance.  With
   optional server support individual packets can receive differentiated
   service.

1.  Introduction

   Senders rely on ramping up their transmission rate until they
   encounter packet loss or see [ECN] indicating they should level off
   or slow down their transmission rate.  This feedback takes time and
   contributes to poor user experience when the sender over- or under-
   shoots the actual available bandwidth, especially if the sender
   changes fidelity of the content (e.g., improves video quality which
   consumes more bandwidth which then gets dropped by the network).

   Due to network constraints a network element will need to discard a
   packet or prioritize a packet ahead of other packets within a single
   UDP 4-tuple.  The network element cannot make an informed decision of
   which packet to discard or pirioritize without knowing the relative
   importance of the packet.  Metadata carried in each packet can inform
   the network element to improve the user experience.

   This document defines CIDFI (pronounced "sid fye") which provides
   host-to-network (h2n) and network-to-host (n2h) signaling.  CIDFI
   always requires two components: a CIDFI-aware client with a QUIC or
   DTLS stack client QUIC and at least one CIDFI-aware network element
   (CNE).  The client sends metadata about incoming CIDs to the CNE (h2n
   signaling) and the CNE sends metadata about its view of the network
   (n2h signaling).  The CNE-aware client can inform the server of
   network constraints it learned via n2h signaling such as by changing
   codecs (e.g., using offer/answer [RFC3264]) or requesting a lower-
   quality streaming video.

   Optionally, a CNE-aware server can be deployed which then allows
   differentiating classes of packets within a flow.  Those
   differentiated packets can be client-to-server or server-to-client.
   By including a CNE-aware server in the system the CNE can provide
   precise packet treatment within a UDP 4-tuple, such as prioritizing
   audio over video.

   Figure 1 provides a sample network diagram of a CIDFI system showing
   two bandwidth-constrained networks (or links) depicted by "B" and
   CIDFI-aware devices immediately upstream of those links, and another
   bandwidth-constrained link between a smartphone handset and its Radio
   Access Network (RAN).  This diagram shows the same protocol and same
   mechanism can operate with or without 5G, and can operate with
   different administrative domains such as Wi-Fi, an ISP edge router,
   and a 5G RAN.

                         Figure 1: Network Diagram

   The CIDFI-aware client establishes a TLS connection with the CIDFI-
   aware network elements (Wi-Fi access point, edge router, and RAN
   router in the above diagram).  Over this connection it receives
   network performance information (n2h) and it sends mapping of (QUIC
   or DTLS) Destination CIDs to packet importance (h2n).

   The design creates new state in the CIDFI-aware network elements for
   mapping from Destination CID to the packet metadata and maintaining
   triggers to update the client if the network characteristics change,
   and to maintain a TLS channel with the client.

   Section 6.3.2 describes network-to-host signaling similar to the use
   case described in Section 2 of [I-D.joras-sadcdn], with metadata
   relaying through the client.

   Section 6.3.1 describes host-to-network metadata signaling similar to
   the use cases described in Section 3 of [I-D.joras-sadcdn].  The
   host-to-network metadata signaling can also benefit
   [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] and [DTLS-CID].

   CIDFI brings benefits to QUIC and DTLS because those protocols are of
   primary interest.  QUIC is quickly replacing HTTPS-over-TCP on many
   websites and content delivery networks because of its advantages to
   both end users and servers, supplanting TCP.  Applications can take
   advantage of QUIC's unreliability to help networks provide reasonable
   service to clients on constrained links, especially as the user
   transitions from a high quality wireless reception to lower quality
   reception (e.g., entering a building).  DTLS is used by WebRTC and
   SIP for establishing interactive real-time audio, video, and screen
   sharing, which benefit from knowing network characteristics (n2h
   signaling) and benefit from prioritizing audio over video (h2n
   signaling).  That said, CIDFI can be extended to other protocols as
   discussed in Appendix A.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   CID:  Connection Identifier used by [QUIC] or by [DTLS-CID].

   CNE:  CIDFI-aware Network Element, a network element that supports
      this CIDFI specification.  This is typically a router.

2.1.  Notations

   For discussion purposes, JSON is used in the examples to give a
   flavor of the data that the client retrieves from a CNE.  The authors
   anticipate using a more efficient encoding such as [CBOR].

3.  Design Goals

   This section highlights the design goals of this specification.

   Client Authorization:  The client authorizes each CIDFI-aware network
      element (CNE) to participate in CIDFI for each QUIC (or DTLS)
      flow.

   Same Server:  When the server also participates in CIDFI, the same
      QUIC connection is used for CIDFI communication with that server,
      which ensures it arrives at the same server instance even in the
      presence of network translators (NAT) or server-side ECMP load
      balancers or server-side CID-aware load balancers
      [I-D.ietf-quic-load-balancers].

   Privacy:  The host-to-network signaling of the mapping from packet
      metadata to CID is only sent to CIDFI-aware network elements
      (CNEs) and is protected by TLS.  The network-to-host signaling of
      network metadata is protected by TLS.  For CIDFI to operate, the
      CNE never needs the server's identity, and the CNE is never
      provided decryption keys for the QUIC communication between the
      client and server.

   Integrity:  The packet importance is mapped to Destination CIDs which
      are integrity protected by QUIC (or DTLS) itself and cannot be
      modified by on-path network elements.  The communication between
      client, server, and network elements is protected by TLS.

   Internet Survival:  The QUIC (or DTLS) communications between clients
      and servers are not changed so CIDFI is expected to work wherever
      QUIC (or DTLS) works.  The elements involved are only the QUIC (or
      DTLS) client and server and with the participating CIDFI-aware
      network elements.

   CIDFI can operate over IPv4, IPv6, IPv4/IPv4 translation (NAT), and
   IPv6/IPv4 translation (NAT64).  Packet metadata is communicated over
   a TLS-encrypted channel from the CIDFI client to its CIDFI-aware
   network elements, and mapped to integrity-protected QUIC (or DTLS)
   Connection Identifiers.

4.  Network Preparation

   The network is configured to advertise its support for CIDFI.

   For this step, four mechanisms are described in this document: DNS
   SVCB records [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https], IPv6 Provisioning Domains
   (PvD) [RFC8801], DHCP [RFC2131][RFC8415], and 3GPP PCO.  These are
   described in the following sub-sections.

      Standardizing all or some of these mechanisms is for further
      discussion.

4.1.  DNS SVCB Records

   This document defines a new DNS Service Binding parameter "cidfi-
   aware" in Section 14.4 and a new Special-Use Domain Name "cifi.arpa"
   in Section 14.3.

   The local network is configured to respond to DNS SVCB
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https] queries with ServiceMode (Section 2.4.3
   of [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https]) for "_cidfi-aware.cidfi.arpa" with
   the DNS names of that network's and upstream network's CIDFI-aware
   network elements (CNEs).  If upstream networks also support CIDFI
   (e.g., the ISP network) those SVCB records are aggregated into the
   local DNS server's response by the local network's recursive DNS
   resolvers.  For example, a query for "_cidfi-aware.cidfi.arpa" might
   return two answers for the two CNEs on the local network, one
   belonging to the local ISP (example.net) and the other belonging to
   the local Wi-Fi network (example.com).

   _cidfi-aware.cidfi.arpa. 7200 IN SVCB 0 service-cidfi.example.net. (
       alpn=h3 cidfipathauth=/path-auth-query {?cidfi}
       cidfimetadata=/cidfi-metadata
       )
   _cidfi-aware.cidfi.arpa. 7200 IN SVCB 0 wifi.example.com. (
       alpn=h3 cidfipathauth=/path-auth-query {?cidfi}
       cidfimetadata=/cidfi-metadata
       )

                     Figure 2: Example of SVCB Records

   When multihoming, the multihome-capable CPE aggregates all upstream
   networks' "_cidfi-aware.cidfi.arpa" responses into the response sent
   to its locally-connected clients.

4.2.  Provisioning Domains

   The CIDFI networks are configured to set the H-flag so clients can
   request PvD Additional Information (Section 4.1 of [RFC8801]).

   The "application/pvd+json" returned looks like what is depicted in
   Figure 3 when there are two CIDFI-aware network elements, service-
   cidfi and wi-fi.

           {
              "cidfi":[
                 {
                    "cidfinode":"service-cidfi.example.net",
                    "cidfipathauth":"/path-auth-query {?cidfi}",
                    "cidfimetadata":"/cidfi-metadata"
                 },
                 {
                    "cidfinode":"wi-fi.example.net",
                    "cidfipathauth":"/path-auth-query {?cidfi}",
                    "cidfimetadata":"/cidfi-metadata"
                 }
              ]
           }

                    Figure 3: Example of PvD Information

   Multiple CIDFI-aware network elements on a network path will require
   propagating the Provisioning Domain Additional Information.  For
   example, a CIDFI-aware Wi-Fi access point connected to a CIDFI-aware
   5G network will require the information for both CIDFI networks be
   available to the client, in a single Provisioning Domain Additional
   Information request.  This means the Wi-Fi access point has to obtain
   that information so the Wi-Fi access point can provide both the 5G
   network's information and the Wi-Fi access point's information.

4.3.  DHCP or 3GPP PCO

   The network is configured to respond to DHCPv6, DHCPv4 sub-option, or
   3GPP PCO (Protocol Configuration Option) Information Element.

5.  Client Operation on Network Attach or Topology Change

   On initial network attach topology change (see Section 9), the client
   learns if the network supports CIDFI (Section 5.1) and authorizes
   discovered network elements (Section 5.2).

5.1.  Client Learns Local Network Supports CIDFI

   For this step, four mechanisms are identified: DNS SVCB records, IPv6
   PvD, DHCP, or 3GPP PCO.  These are described in the following sub-
   sections.

   In all cases below,

   *  if the discovery succeeds (i.e., the client concludes that the
      local and/or ISP network support CIDFI) client processing proceeds
      to Section 5.2.

   *  if the discovery failed (i.e., the client concludes that the local
      network and ISP do not support CIDFI) client processing stops.

5.1.1.  Client Learns Using DNS SVCB

   The client determines if the local network provides CIDFI service by
   issuing a query to the local DNS server for "_cidfi-
   aware.cidfi.arpa." with the SVCB resource record type (64)
   [I-D.ietf-dnsop-svcb-https].

5.1.2.  Client Learns Using Provisioning Domain

   The client determines if the local network supports CIDFI by querying
   https://<PvD-ID>/.well-known/pvd as described in Section 4.1 of
   [RFC8801].

5.1.3.  Client Learns Using DHCP or 3GPP PCO

   The client determines that a local network is CIDFI-capable if the
   client receives an explicit signal from the network, e.g., via a
   dedicated DHCP option or a 3GPP PCO (Protocol Configuration Option)
   Information Element.  An example of explicit signal would be a DHCPv6
   option or DHCPv4 sub-option that that is returned as part of
   [RFC7839].

5.2.  Client Authorizes CIDFI-aware Network Elements

   The response from the previous step in Section 5.1 will contain one
   or more CNEs.

   The client authorizes each of the CNEs using a local policy.  This
   policy is implementation-specific.  An implementation example might
   have the users authorize their ISP's CIDFI server (e.g., allow
   "cidfi.example.net" if a user's ISP is configured with
   "example.net").  Similarly, if none of the CNEs are recognized by the
   client, the client might silently avoid using CIDFI on that network.

   After authorizing that subset of CNEs, the client makes a new HTTPS
   connection to each of those CNEs and performs PKIX validation of
   their certificates.  The client MAY have to authenticate itself to
   the CNE.

   The client then obtains the CIDFI nonce and CIDFI HMAC secret from
   each CNE used later in Section 6.2 to prove the client owns its UDP
   4-tuple.

   {
      "cidfi-path-authentication":[
         {
            "nonce":"ddqwohxGZysgy0BySNh7sNHV5IH9RbE7rqXmg9wb9Npo",
            "hmac-secret":"jLNsCvuU59mt3F4/ePD9jbZ932TfsLSOP2Nx3XnUqc8v"
         }
      ]
   }

                 Figure 4: Example of CIDFI HMAC and Nonce

6.  Client Operation on Each Connection to a QUIC Server

   When a QUIC client (or DTLS-CID) client connects to a QUIC (or DTLS-
   CID) server, the client:

   1.  learns if the server supports CIDFI and obtains its mapping of
       transmitted Destination CIDs to metadata, described in
       Section 6.1.

   2.  proves ownership of its UDP 4-tuple to the on-path CNEs,
       described in Section 6.2.

   3.  performs initial metadata exchange with the CIDFI network element
       and server, and server and network element, described in
       Section 6.3.

   4.  for the duration of the connection, receives network-to-host and
       performs host-to-network updates as network conditions or network
       requirements change, described in Section 7.

      Note: the client is also a sender, and can also perform all these
      functions in its direction.  This functionality will be expanded
      in later versions of this document.  For example, a mobile device
      connected to Wi-Fi with 5G backhaul might be running an
      interactive audio/video application and want to indicate to its
      internal Wi-Fi driver and to the 5G modem its mapping from its
      transmitted QUIC Destination CID to per-packet metadata and the
      application can benefit from receiving network performance
      metrics.

6.1.  Client Learns Server Supports CIDFI

   On initial connection to a QUIC server, the client includes a new
   QUIC transport parameter CIDFI (Section 14.1) which is remembered for
   0-RTT.

   If the server does not indicate CIDFI support, the client can still
   perform CIDFI -- but does not expect different CIDs to indicate
   differentiated behavior.  The client can still signal its CNE about
   the flow, because the client knows some characteristics of the flow
   it is receiving.  For example, if the client requested streaming
   video of a certain bandwidth from the server or participated in a
   WebRTC offer/answer exchange, the client knows some connectivity
   expectation about the incoming flow without the server supporting
   CIDFI.  Processing continues with the next step.

   If the server indicates CIDFI support, then the server creates a new
   Server-Initiated, Bidirectional QUIC stream which is dedicated to
   CIDFI communication.  This stream number is communicated in the CIDFI
   transport response during the QUIC handshake.

      TODO: Specify how CIDFI stream number is communicated to client.

   The QUIC client and server exchange CIDFI information over this
   CIDFI-dedicated stream as described in Section 6.3.

   Processing continues with the next step.

6.2.  Client Proves Ownership of its UDP 4-Tuple

   To ensure that the client messages to a CNE pertain only to the
   client's own UDP 4-tuple, the client sends the CIDFI nonce protected
   by the HMAC secret it obtained from Section 5.2 over the QUIC UDP
   4-tuple it is using with the QUIC server.  The ability to transmit
   that packet on the same UDP 4-tuple as the QUIC connection indicates
   ownership of that IP address and UDP port.  The nonce and HMAC are
   sent in a [STUN] indication (STUN class of 0b01) containing one or
   more CIDFI-NONCE attributes (Section 14.5).  If there are multiple
   CNEs the single STUN indication contains a CIDFI-NONCE attribute from
   each of them.  This message is discarded by the QUIC server.

   Figure 5 shows a summarized message flow obtaining the nonce and HMAC
   secret from the CNE then later sending the nonce and HMAC in the same
   UDP 4-tuple towards the QUIC server:

   The short header's Destination Connection ID (DCID) can be 0 bytes or
   as short as 8 bits, so multiple QUIC clients are likely to use the
   same incoming Destination CID on their own UDP 4-tuple.  The STUN
   Indication message allows the CIDFI network element to distinguish
   each QUIC client's UDP 4-tuple.

   Because multiple QUIC clients will use the same incoming Destination
   CID on their own UDP 4-tuple, the STUN Indication message also allows
   a CNE to distinguish which UDP 4-tuple belongs to each CIDFI client.

   To reduce CIDFI setup time the client STUN Indication MAY be sent at
   the same time as the QUIC Initial packet (Section 17.2.2 of [QUIC]),
   which is encouraged if the client remembers the server supports CIDFI
   (0-RTT).

   To prevent replay attacks, the Nonce is usable only for
   authenticating one UDP 4-tuple.  When the connection is migrated
   (Section 9 of [QUIC]) the CNE won't apply any CIDFI behavior to that
   newly-migrated connection.  The client will have to restart CIDFI
   procedures at the beginning (Section 5).

   Processing continues with the next step.

               Figure 6: Format of STUN CIDFI-NONCE Attribute

   The nonce is 128 bits obtained from the CIDFI network element.  The
   HMAC-output field is computed per [RFC5869] using the CIDFI network
   element-provided HMAC secret, and the CIDFI network element-provided
   Nonce concatenated with the fixed string "cidfi" (without quotes),
   shown below with "|" denoting concatenation.

     HMAC-output = HMAC-SHA256( hmac-secret, nonce | "cidfi" )

6.3.  Initial Metadata Exchange

   Using its HTTPS channel with each of the CNEs it previously
   authorized for CIDFI participation, the client signals the mapping of
   the server's transmitted short Destination Connection ID and its
   length to the CNE.  As server support of the QUIC CIDFI transport
   parameter is remembered for 0-RTT, the client can immediately send
   the nonce.

   The primary purpose of a second Connection ID is connection migration
   (Section 9 of [QUIC]).  With CIDFI, additional Connection IDs are
   necessary to:

   *  maintain CIDFI operation when topology remains the same.

   *  use Destination Connection ID to indicate packet importance

   To maintain CIDFI operation when topology remains the same, the CIDFI
   client signals the CNEs of that 'next' Destination CID.  When QUIC
   detects a topology change, however, that Destination CID MUST NOT be
   used by the peer, otherwise it links the communication on the old
   topology to the new topology (Section 9.5 of [QUIC]).  Thus, an
   additional Connection ID is purposefully not communicated from the
   CIDFI client to its CNEs, so that Connection ID can be immediately
   used by the peer during connection migration when the topology
   changes.

   Note that the source IP address and source UDP port number are not
   signaled by design.  This is because NATs ([NAPT], [NAT]), multiple
   NATs on the path, IPv6/IPv4 translation, similar technologies, and
   QUIC connection migration all complicate accurate signaling of the
   source IP address and source UDP port number.

   If the CNE receives the HTTPS map request but has not yet seen the
   STUN nonce message it rejects the mapping request with a 403 and
   provides a new nonce.  The new nonce avoids the problem of an
   attacker seeing the previous nonce and using that nonce on its own
   UDP 4-tuple.  The client then sends a new STUN message with that new
   nonce value and send a new HTTPS mapping request(s).  This
   interaction is highlighted in the simplified message flow in
   Figure 7.

   After the initial metadata is exchanged, processing continues with
   ongoing host-to-network and network-to-host updates as described in
   Section 7.

   There are two types of metadata exchanged, described in the following
   sub-sections.

6.3.1.  Host to Network Signaling

   The server communicates to CNEs via the client which then
   communicates with the CNE(s).  While this adds communication delay,
   it allows the user at the client to authorize the metadata
   communication about its own incoming (and outgoing) traffic.

   The communication from the client to the server are using a CIDFI-
   dedicated QUIC stream over the same QUIC connection as their primary
   communication (Figure 8).

                  Figure 8: Example of CIDIF Communication

   To each of the network elements authorized by the client, the client
   sends the mappings of the server's transmitted Destination CIDs to
   packet metadata (see Section 10).

6.3.2.  Network to Host Signaling

   The CNE sends network performance information to the server which is
   intended to influence the sender's traffic rate (such as improving or
   reducing fidelity of the audio or video).  In Figure 9, the CNE
   informs the client of reduced bandwidth and the client informs the
   server using CIDFI.

            +----------------------------------->|            |

      Figure 9: Example of CIDIFI Communication with Metadata Sharing

   The communication from the client to the server is using a CIDFI-
   dedicated QUIC stream over the same QUIC connection as their primary
   communication.

   The CNE can update the client with whenever the metadata about the
   connection changes significantly, but MUST NOT update more frequently
   than once every second.

   The metadata exchanged over this channel is described in Section 10.

7.  Ongoing Signaling

   Throughout the life of the connection host-to-network and network-to-
   host signaling is updated whenever charactertics change.

   Typically, due to environmental changes on wireless networks or other
   user's traffic patterns, a particular flow may be able to operate
   faster or might need to operate slower.  The relevant CNE SHOULD
   signal such conditions to the client (Section 6.3.2), which can then
   relay that information to the server using either CIDFI or via its
   application.

   For example, a streaming video client might be retrieving low quality
   video because one of their invoked CNEs indicated constrained
   bandwidth.  Later, after moving closer to an antenna, more bandwidth
   is available which is signaled by the CNE to the client.  The client
   uses that signal to now request higher-quality video from the server.

   Similarly, the CIDFI client may begin receiving traffic with
   different characteristics which might be be signaled to the CIDFI
   Network Elements.

   For example, a client might be participating in an audio-only call
   which is modified to audio and video, requiring additional bandwidth
   and likely new CIDs to differentiate the video packets from the audio
   packets.

8.  Interaction with Load Balancers

   QUIC servers are frequently behind CID-aware load balancers
   [I-D.ietf-quic-load-balancers].

   With CIDFI, all the communications to the load-balanced QUIC server
   are over the same UDP 4-tuple as the primary QUIC connection but in a
   different QUIC stream.  This means no changes are required to ECMP
   load balancers or to CID-aware load balancers when using a CIDFI-
   aware back-end QUIC server.

   Load balancers providing QUIC-to-TCP interworking are incompatible
   with CIDFI because TCP lacks QUIC's stream identification.

9.  Topology Change

   When the topology changes the client will transmit from a new IP
   address -- such as switching to a backup WAN connection, or such as
   switching from Wi-Fi to 5G.  If using QUIC, the server will consider
   this as a connection migration (Section 9 of [QUIC]) and will issue a
   PATH_CHALLENGE.  If the client is aware of the topology change (such
   as attaching to a different network), the client would also change
   its QUIC Destination CID (Section 9 of [QUIC]).

   When the CIDFI-aware client determines that it is connected to a new
   network or has received a QUIC PATH_CHALLENGE, the CIDFI-aware client
   MUST re-discover its CNEs (Section 5.1) and continue with normal
   CIDFI processing with any discovered CNEs.

      todo: include discussion of [DTLS-CID] client and discussion of
      its ICE interaction, if any?

10.  Details of Metadata Exchanged

   This section describes the metadata that can be exchanged from a CNE
   to a server (generally network performance information) and from the
   server to a CNE.

10.1.  Server to CIDFI-aware Network Element

   Because there is no direct communication from the server to a CNE,
   the communication is relayed through the client.

   The communications from servers to CNEs do not occur directly, but
   rather through the client.

   Two types of mapping metadata are described in the following sub-
   sections: metadata parameters and DSCP values.

10.1.1.  Mapping Metadata Parameters to DCIDs

   Several of metadata parameters can be mapped to Destination CIDs:

   Importance:  Low/Medium/High importance, relative to other CIDs
      within this same UDP 4-tuple.

   Delay budget:  Time in milliseconds until this packet is worthless to
      the receiver.  This is counted from when the packet arrives at the
      CNE to when it is transmitted; other delays may occur before or
      after that event occurs.  The receiver knows its own jitter
      (playout) buffer length and the client and server can calculate
      the one-way delay using timestamps.  With that information, the
      client can adjust the server's signaled delay budget with the
      client's own knowledge.

      TODO: provide enough details to create interoperable
      implementations.

   Over the CIDFI-dedicated QUIC stream, the server sends mapping
   information to the client when then propagates that information to
   each of the CNEs.  An example is shown in Figure 10.

10.1.2.  Mapping DiffServ Code Point (DSCP) to DCIDs

   A mapping from Destination CID to DiffServ code point [RFC2474]
   leverages existing DiffServ handling that may already exist in the
   CIDFI network element.  If there are downstream network elements
   configured with the same DSCP the CIDFI network element could mark
   the packet with that code point as well.

   Signaling the DSCP values for different QUIC Destination CIDs
   increases the edge network's confidence that the sender's DiffServ
   intent is preserved into the edge network, even if the DSCP bits were
   modified en route to the edge network (e.g., [pathologies]).

   Over the CIDFI-dedicated QUIC stream, the server sends the mapping
   information to the client when then propagates that information to
   each of the CNEs.

   An example is shown in Figure 11.

   {
      "dscp":[
         {
            "quicversion":1,
            "dcidlength":3,
            "map":[
               {
                  "dscp":10,
                  "dcids":[
                     123,
                     456
                  ]
               },
               {
                  "dscp":46,
                  "dcids":[
                     998,
                     183
                  ]
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }

10.2.  CIDFI-aware Network Element to Server

   The CIDFI-aware client informs the CNE of the client's received
   Destination CIDs.  As bandwidth availability to that client changes,
   the CNE updates the client with new metadata.

   {
      "dcid":123,
      "bandwidth":"1Mbps"
   }

   The client then sends that information to the server in the CIDFI-
   dedicated QUIC stream associated with that same Connection ID.

11.  Discussion Points

   This section discusses known issues that would benefit from wider
   discussion.

11.1.  Client versus Server Signaling CID-to-importance Mapping

   Need to evaluate number of round trips (and other overhead) of client
   signaling CID-to-importance mapping or server signaling CID-to-
   importance mapping.

11.2.  Overhead of QUIC DCID Packet Examination

   If CID-to-importance metadata was signaled by the server as described
   in Section 6.3.1, the CNE have to examine the UDP payload of each
   packet for a matching Destination CID for the lifetime of the
   connection.  This is somewhat assuaged by the STUN nonce transmitted
   which may well be an easier signal to identify.

11.3.  Interaction with Wi-Fi Packet Aggregation

   Per-packet metadata influences transmission of that packet but may
   well conflict with some Wi-Fi optimizations (e.g.,
   [wifi-aggregation]) and similar 5G optimizations.

   This impact needs further study.

11.4.  Overhead of Mapping CIDs to Packet Metadata

   Network Elements have to maintain a mapping between each UDP 4-tuple
   and QUIC CID and its DSCP code point.  This also needs updating
   whenever sender changes its CID.  This is awkward.

   An alternative is a fixed mapping of QUIC CIDs to their meanings, as
   proposed in [I-D.zmlk-quic-te].  However, this will ossify the
   meaning of those QUIC CIDs.  It also requires all networks to agree
   on the meaning of those QUIC CIDs.

11.5.  Improve CIDFI Initialization Time

   Find approaches to further reduce network communications to start
   CIDFI.

11.6.  Primary QUIC Channel CID Change

   Because the CIDFI network element, QUIC server, and QUIC client all
   cooperate to share the primary QUIC connection's Destination CID,
   when a new CIDFI network element is involved (e.g., due to client
   attaching to a different network), a new Destination CID SHOULD be
   used for the reasons discussed in Section 9.5 of [QUIC]}.

   We need clear way to signal which DCIDs can be used for 'this'
   network attach and which DCIDs are for a migrated connection.
   Probably belongs in the QUIC transport parameter signaling?

12.  State Maintenance

   A CNE can safely remove state after UDP inactivity timeout
   Section 4.3 of [RFC4787].  The CIDFI client MUST re-signal its CNE(s)
   when it receives a QUIC path validation message, as that indicates a
   NAT rebinding occurred.  A CNE's state can also be cleared by
   signaling from the CIDFI client, such as when closing the
   application; however, this signal cannot be relied upon due to
   network disconnect, battery depletion, and suchlike.

      probably want keepalives on client->CNE communication.  TODO.

13.  Security Considerations

   Because the sender's QUIC Destination Connection ID is mapped to
   packet importance, and the DCID remains the same for many packets, an
   attacker could determine which DCIDs are important by causing
   interference on the bandwidth-constrained link (by creating other
   legitimate traffic or creating radio interference) and observing
   which DCIDs are transmitted versus which DCIDs are dropped.  This is
   a side- effect of using fixed identifier (DCIDs) rather than
   encrypting the packet importance.  This was a design trade-off to
   reduce the CPU effort on the CNEs.  A mitigation is using several
   DCIDs for every packet importance.

   Communications are relayed through the client because only the client
   and server knows the identity of the server and can validate its
   certificate.  The protocol in this specification does not disclose
   the server's identity to the CIDFI network element.

   For an attacker to succeed with the nonce challenge against a
   victim's UDP 4-tuple the attacker has to send a STUN CIDFI-NONCE
   packet using the victim's source IP address and a valid HMAC.  A
   valid HMAC can only be obtained by the attacker making its own
   connection to the CIDFI server and spoofing the source IP address and
   UDP port of the victim.  Such spoofing of a victim's IP address is
   prevented by the network using network ingress filtering ([RFC2827],
   [RFC7513], [RFC6105], and/or [RFC6620]).  In the event network
   ingress filtering is not configured or configured improperly, the
   CIDFI network element can detect an attack if the client implements
   CIDFI.  The CIDFI network element receive two HTTPS connections
   describing the same DCID (one connection from the attacker, another
   from the victim).  The CIDFI network element will issue unique Nonces
   and HMACs to both the attacker and victim, and the attacker and
   victim will both send the STUN indication on that same UDP 4-tuple.
   This should never normally occur and should generate an alarm on the
   CIDFI network element.  In this situation, it is recommended both
   attack and victim be denied CIDFI access.

   If attacker can see the victim's Discovery Packet and attacker can
   send that packet inside the attacker's 5-tuple and race it to the on-
   path CIDFI network element (which needs to see the Discovery Packet)
   the attacker can then 'steal' the victim's CIDFI control from the
   victim's 5-tuple and the victim's CIDFI signaling thereafter for that
   5-tuple will influence the attacker's 5-tuple.  The attacker can't
   see that CIDFI signaling (because it still goes to the victim which
   relays the CIDFI signaling to the CIDFI network element) but with
   this attack the victim's CIDFI treatment is effectively disabled and
   is available to the attacker.  The attacker can send
   NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames to the server with the victim's (observed)
   Destination CID, effectively stealing the victim's CIDFI signaling
   for themselves.  To mitigate this replay attack shared networks need
   per-endpoint encryption (e.g., Wi-Fi WPA3, DOCSIS BPI+) or traffic
   separation (e.g., Ethernet switching rather than bridging).

Appendix A.  Extending CIDFI to Other Protocols

   CIDFI can be extended to other protocols including TCP, SCTP, RTP and
   SRTP, and bespoke UDP protocols.

   An extension to each protocol is described below which retains the
   ability of the client to prove its ownership of the 5-tuple to a CNE.

A.1.  TCP

   To prove ownership of the TCP 4-tuple, TCP can utilize a new TCP
   option to carry the CNE's nonce and HMAC-output.  This TCP option can
   be carried in both the TCP SYN and in some subsequent packets to
   avoid consuming the entire TCP option space (40 bytes).  Sub-options
   can be defined to carry pieces of the Nonce and HMAC output, with the
   first piece of the Nonce in the TCP SYN so the CIDFI network element
   can be triggered to begin looking for the subsequent TCP frames
   containing the rest of the CIDFI nonce and CIDFI HMAC-output.  For
   example,

   1.  send TCP SYN + CIDFI option (including Nonce bits 0-63)

   2.  if received TCP SYNACK does not indicate CIDFI support, stop
       sending CIDFI option

   3.  send next TCP packet + CIDFI option (including Nonce bytes
       64-128)

   4.  send next TCP packet + CIDFI option (including HMAC-output bits
       0-127)

   5.  send next TCP packet + CIDFI option (including HMAC-output bytes
       128-256)

   To shorten this further we might truncate the HMAC output and/or
   truncate the Nonce after security evaluation.

A.2.  SCTP

   If SCTP is sent directly over IP, proof of ownership of the SCTP
   4-tuple can be achieved using an extension to its INIT packets,
   similar to what is described above for TCP SYN.

   If SCTP is run over UDP, the same proof of ownership of the UDP
   4-tuple as described in Section 6.2 can be performed.

A.3.  RTP and SRTP

   The RTP Synchronization Source (SSRC) is in the clear for [RTP],
   [SRTP], and [cryptex].  If the SSRC is signaled similarly to CID, RTP
   could also benefit from CIDFI.  CIDFI network elements could be told
   the mapping of SSRC values to importance and schedule those SSRCs
   accordingly.  However, SSRC is used in playout (jitter) buffers and a
   new SSRC seen by a receiver will cause confusion.  Thus, overloading
   SSRC to mean both 'packet importance' for CIDFI and 'synchronization
   source' will require engineering work on the RTP receiver to treat
   all the signaled SSRCs as one source for purposes of its playout
   buffer.

   RTP over QUIC [I-D.ietf-avtcore-rtp-over-quic] is another approach
   which exposes QUIC headers to the network (which have CIDs) and does
   not overload the RTP SSRC.  The Media over QUIC (MOQ) working group
   includes RTP over QUIC as one of its use cases Section 3.1 of
   [I-D.ietf-moq-requirements].

A.4.  Bespoke UDP Application Protocols

   To work with CIDFI, other UDP application protocols would have to
   prove ownership of their UDP 4-tuple (Section 6.2) and extend their
   protocol to include a connection identifier in the first several bits
   of each of their UDP packets.

   Alternatively, rather than modifying the application protocol it
   could be run over [QUIC] or [DTLS-CID].
